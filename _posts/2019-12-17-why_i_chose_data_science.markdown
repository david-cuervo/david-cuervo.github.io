Starting this course has introduced me to a lot of new things, including writing blog posts! So I'm hoping my writing improves along with my coding. 

Nonetheless, I thought to write my first post about why I chose to do this course. Currently, I'm working as a contractor for a state agency. My contract is for 2 years and I've been working here for about a year and a half. In this time, my work has been miminal to say the least. I found myself pretty unfulfilled and unutilized. So after listening to this episode of [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/28/642706138/bs-jobs-how-meaningless-work-wears-us-down) (which I highly recommend) I decided I had to find something to get me out of my "BS" job.

Flatiron came to me at the perfect moment through a good friend of mine. He had a lot of great things to say about his experience and I figured I could do self-paced while I continued to work and finish out my contract. 

I got my Masters in Public Health in 2017 and I had learned a lot about statistics so I thought this data science course wouldn't be too much of a departure. I learned how to code in STATA mostly and a bit in SAS but it's exciting to learn Python, especially since I want more opportunities after I leave my current job. Also, my STATA class was my favorite during grad school and I'm happy to be experiencing that same appreciation as I work through this first module. 

I'm hoping after I finish I'll have a chance to find a job where I feel useful and valued. I think as a data scientist I'll be able to put out work that I can be proud of.
